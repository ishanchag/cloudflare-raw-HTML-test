**This week I have completed my first publicly viewable web design project**
You can view it [here](https://www.apexracing.uk). This project was a test to see how easy and intuitive Google Sites was being a piece of free software. The experiment was extremely interesting and I found Google Sites to be a neat piece of software. Highlight features include: embed code feature (useful for iframes and other HTML items), branding features (auto colour schemes and handling of header and footer) and the free hosting - Google Sites hosts your website, even with a custom domain, free of charge with a few simple changes in the DNS records. I would highly recommend this for people starting out in Web Development because of how it nicely combined simplicity and flexibility all in a free web-based program. Tomorrow or sone time this week I am going to explore Weebly and Wix as website builders because of their popularity with beginners with a longer WordPress post planned for the future along with a Hugo review.
